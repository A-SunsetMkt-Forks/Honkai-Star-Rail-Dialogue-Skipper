# Honkai-Star-Rail-Dialogue-Skipper

A very simple AutoHotKey script to autoclick and skip dialogue quickly. Third-party software always comes with a risk of account suspension or ban.

## Setup

- Install [AutoHotkey](https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey) to run the code.
- Run autohotkey .ahk file as administrator otherwise it won't work in game. 
- The script is configured for a screen resolution of 1920x1080
- The hotkey to activate the script is F12.
- The script is programmed to stop after 60 seconds to prevent the user from getting stuck due to continuous clicking in the same location.

If you have a different screen resolution, you will need to adjust the default coordinates of 1350, 750 in the script.

Below a list of approximate coordinates,
- 1280x720: (960, 540)
- 1366x768: (1024, 576)
- 1600x900: (1200, 675)
- 1920x1080: (1350, 750)
- 2560x1440: (1920, 1080)
- 3840x2160: (2700, 1500)

Note that these coordinates are approximate and may require some adjustment based on individual systems and configurations.
