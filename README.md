- If script is still up, it means i wasn't banned for using it. Still, third-party software always comes with a risk of account suspension or ban. 

- The script is configured for a screen resolution of 1920x1080
- The hotkey to activate the script is F12.
- The script is programmed to stop after 60 seconds to prevent the user from getting stuck due to continuous clicking in the same location.

If you have a different screen resolution, you will need to adjust the default coordinates of 1350, 750 in the script.

Below a list of approximate coordinates,
- 1280x720: (960, 540)
- 1366x768: (1024, 576)
- 1600x900: (1200, 675)
- 1920x1080: (1350, 750)
- 2560x1440: (1920, 1080)
- 3840x2160: (2700, 1500)

Note that these coordinates are approximate and may require some adjustment based on individual systems and configurations.

For best results, we recommend testing the script on a blank page or by using a program such as Paint to determine the exact coordinates neededfor your specific screen resolution.
Simply open Paint in maximum resolution, select a color, and test the script by running it and observing where it clicks on the page. 
You can then adjust the coordinates in the script to match the location you want to click on
